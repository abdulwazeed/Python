A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming language, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    i=0   
    while i < n:
     print(i*i)
     i+=1
     
 if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    i=0   
    for i in range(n):
     print(i*i)
     i+=1
